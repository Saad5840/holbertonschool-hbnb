# HBnB Evolution â€“ High-Level Package Diagram

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

This document presents the high-level package diagram for the HBnB Evolution application. It shows the three-layer architecture â€” **Presentation**, **Business Logic**, and **Persistence** â€” and how these layers interact using the **Facade Pattern**.

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

### 1. Presentation Layer
- Responsible for user interaction.
- Includes API endpoints and service interfaces.
- Sends requests to the Business Logic layer via the Facade.

### 2. Business Logic Layer
- Contains core application logic and models:
  - `User`, `Place`, `Review`, and `Amenity`.
- Acts as the centralized brain of the system.
- Provides a **Facade Interface** to expose controlled access to its functionalities.

### 3. Persistence Layer
- Handles data access and storage.
- Includes database connectors, data mappers, or repositories.
- Business Logic delegates data operations to this layer.

## ðŸŽ¯ Facade Pattern Role

The **Facade Pattern** is used between:
- **Presentation â†’ Business Logic**

It simplifies the interaction by exposing a unified interface (e.g., `HBnBService`) that aggregates operations on Users, Places, Reviews, and Amenities. This hides internal complexity and makes the system easier to use and test.
